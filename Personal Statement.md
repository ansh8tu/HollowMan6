[中文版](个人陈述.md)

Looking back into my past, when I got my computer at 8, I instantly fell in love with it. As I managed to run Linux From Scratch and Hackintosh on my computer and saw the amazement in programming after I learned Visual Basic during middle school, this love grew deeper and deeper. Then in 2018, I began my undergraduate life majoring in Computer Science at Lanzhou University and successfully entered Honour Class (Specialized Class for Fundamentals and Theories).

Upon entering the university, gradually I began to develop enthusiasm in Open Source guided by senior students at Lanzhou University Open Source Society. I set up my own Github account (@HollowMan6) and whenever I wrote some interesting programs, I would make a repository for it and post it on Github. I appreciate the open-source spirit and devote most of my free time to contributing to Github. I have contributed to many popular projects and over 60 organizations including TensorFlow, Node.js, Python, Kubernetes, etc. This helps me gain nearly 1.5k followers and over 110 personal project stars on Github. Moreover, Open Source has also blessed me with a lot of new knowledge and skills. By referring to the open-source project and tutorials on Github, I have learned Go, React, Vue.js, C#, Flutter, Arduino, Android App Development by myself that can’t be found in the university undergraduate curriculum. This knowledge has greatly broadened my vision.

During the first few months at university, I self-learned Python, using it to build a web crawler, and successfully found many flaws in Chinese online voting systems. Afterward, I designed a system that can solve these flaws, independently wrote an essay *Voting System Based on Wechat Pay* (in Chinese) and got it published in *COMPUTER ENGINEERING & SOFTWARE*, one of the Chinese Core Journals.

In 2019, I started to develop an interest in AI especially in the realm of Computer Vision. I took Deep Learning courses on Coursera, finally passed them, got certifications from IBM, Google, deeplearning.ai, etc. and abundant knowledge related to Data Science and AI. When the spring semester began, I also participated in the Lanzhou University Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project *“Renaissance”—AI + Dunhuang* cooperated with the other 3 guided by Prof. Qingguo Zhou. Our project was honored Best University Project of the Year after the final evaluation. Apart from the knowledge required by the project, I also gained many practical academic research and coding skills during the project period. During my time at university, I have also taken part in Google InnoCamp — AI Summer Camp at China 2 times, using DCGAN to make an auto animation image generation model and Tensorflow.js for a website that can recognize the drawing into LATEX code. Also, I have cooperated with others using TinyML and OpenCV to make a self-balanced bike, face recognition lock system, and using Pytorch to realize super-resolution model SRMD, Tensorflow to distinguish skin cancer, etc. Moreover, I have realized a completed image & video information hiding encryption and decryption software by myself referring to the algorithms described in related papers. These projects have greatly advanced my learning related to AI and Computer Vision and made my university life fruitful.

To broaden my vision as a Computer Science undergraduate student, I endeavored to apply to exchange at the University of Leeds during the 2019/20 spring semester in the UK. As a consequence, I became the only student in Lanzhou University who got sponsored by China Scholarship Council Excellent Undergraduate International Exchange Programme and as a government-sponsored exchange student in that semester. Though the coronavirus pandemic had a huge impact on everyone during 2020, I still got invaluable experiences from studying abroad. The most impressive experience was that I managed to use Python Flask to develop a Sports Centre Management System as the coursework for *Software Engineering Project* cooperated with 2 native British students. During the project period, I successfully broke down the communication barrier and learned a great amount of knowledge about project management and coding styles.

When the 2020 summer holiday began, I took two Open Source Internships online simultaneously, one at Emacs (China) under the fund of Open Source Promotion Plan – Summer 2020 by Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, another at Arthas under the fund of Alibaba Summer of Code. During the summertime, I quickly changed from a novice of the two communities into a senior contributor and completed the task excellently through detailed plans. I also actively participated in the community discussion, explored solutions to the requirements even beyond the compulsory tasks, promptly responded and carried out the change requests proposed by the tutors. All the tutors from the two communities gave me a high appraisal of what I have done during the internships. Through the two internships, I exercised my team cooperation and communication skills, and also, I got tremendous experience and skills participating and contributing to big projects.
