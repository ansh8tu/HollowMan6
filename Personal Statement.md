[中文版](个人陈述.md)

Looking back into my past, when I got my own computer at 8, I instantly fell in love with it. As I managed to ran Linux From Scratch and Hackintosh on my computer and saw the amazement in programming during middle school, this love grew deeper and deeper. Then in 2018 I began my undergraduate life majoring in Computer Science at Lanzhou University and successfully entered Honour Class (Specialized Class for Fundamentals and Theories).

Upon entering the university, gradually I began to develop enthusiasm in Open Source guided by senior students at Lanzhou University Open Source Society. I set up my own Github account (@HollowMan6) and whenever I wrote some interesting programmes, I would make a repository for it and post it on Github. I really appreciate the open source spirit and devote most of my free time contributing on Github. I have contributed to many popular projects including TensorFlow etc. This helps me gain 1.5k followers and over 100 stars on Github.

During the first few months in university, I self-learned Python, using it to build a web crawler and successfully found many flaws in Chinese online voting systems. Afterwards I designed a system that can solve these flaws, independently wrote an essay *Voting System Based on Wechat Pay* (in Chinese) and got it published in *COMPUTER ENGINEERING & SOFTWARE*, one of the Chinese Core Journals.

Then in 2019, I started to develop interest in AI especially in the realm of Computer Vision. I took Deep Learning courses on Coursera, finally passed them, got the certifications and abundant knowledge during the winter holiday. When spring semester began, I participated in the Lanzhou University Innovation and Entrepreneurship Project *“Renaissance”—AI + Dunhuang* cooperated with the other 3 guided by Prof. Qingguo Zhou. Our project was honoured Best University Project of the Year after the final evaluation. Apart from the knowledge required by the project, I also gained many practical academic research and coding skills during the project period.

Later, in order to broaden my vision as a Computer Science undergraduate student, I endeavoured to apply to exchange at the University of Leeds during 2019/20 spring semester in the UK. As a consequence, I became the only student in Lanzhou University who got sponsored by China Scholarship Council Excellent Student Exchange Programme  in that semester. Though the coronavirus pandemic had a huge impact on everyone during 2020, I still got invaluable experiences from studying abroad. The most impressive experience was that I managed to use Python Flask to develop a Sport Centre Management System as the coursework for *Software Engineering Project* cooperated with 2 native British students. During the project I successfully broke down the communication barrier and learned a great amount of knowledge about project management and coding styles.

After I managed to get back to China when 2020 summer holiday began, I took two Open Source Internships online simultaneously, one at Emacs (China) under the fund of Open Source Promotion Plan – Summer 2020 by Institute of Software Chinese Academy of Sciences, another at Arthas under the fund of Alibaba Summer of Code. During the summertime, I quickly changed from a novice of the two communities into a senior contributor and completed the task excellently through detailed plans. I also actively participated in the community discussion, explored solutions to the requirements even beyond the compulsory tasks, promptly responded and carried out the change requests proposed by the tutors. All the tutors from the two communities gave me a high appraisal of what I have done during the internships. Through the two internships, I exercised my team cooperation and communication skills and also, I got tremendous experience and skills participating and contributing in big projects.
